@canadagoose , I live in Chicago! Any chance you can recommend a cleaners for my Chilliwack?? It’s 8 yrs old and is due for one!!! Thanks!
Agree that @canadagoose selling real animal fur as a finishing detail on their 'luxury' parkas is & attempting to make up for it by other socially responsible activities does not make it ok. Also I wish people were more aware of this. ..

Canada Goose coats are cruel and overpriced. If you want a warm coat that’s weather resistant and affordable without being made of dead animals I suggest people take a look at Save The Duck. I just bought mine. https:// savetheduckusa.com

Stop killing animals for your jackets!! You can use faux fur and still be profitable! I just bought a coat from Save The Duck and it’s warmer AND cruelty free. I recommend everyone buy from that brand instead. #BoycottCanadaGoose

The world will only go vegan if all the animals were extinct. CanadaGoose will never go out of business because there are plenty of people supporting it, and some of those people are billionaires. Your cause is pointless, especially when you kill more animals than you save.
Why would they protest outside his house? Let the man have some damn rest and relaxation. Protest at a production center or distribution center if you're going to protest.

90 degrees left: Gary the Canada goose was late again. The flock had taken off without him, and he was racing to catch up. Little did he know that the air traffic was miserable, and a rare goose jam was straight ahead. “$&@*!”, he thought as he barreled into the pileup.

On Sunday, I was made to feel like I was going OTT for asking a family member not to fantasize about buying a Canada Goose jacket with Coyote fur... Justification behind it was that 'the ones without fur on it won't hurt anything'

In my head Canada goose is now a premium vodka brand made from maple syrup and you have pitched this and I have already bought it and you haven't even tried and I'm not sure the point I'm trying to make so I'll go. Oh, wait a second, you're really good at writing. That was it!
Be The Canada Goose You Want To See In The World
Ugh, I've totally lost my nerve with work - not pitching, generally useless, clinging to security of side hustle. Kick up the arse? Life coach (can't afford, would have to be a Canada goose )?
This is awesome! Well done peta
Gross why would anyone want to walk around wearing an abused animal corpse.
Sorry to see you're clinging to your deflections instead of considering a more compassionate outlook on life. I understand it's unlikely you'll be convinced to change your mind by a random stranger on Twitter but hopefully you'll make your way there some other way. Cheers.
So, kill them to be kind? I hope you realise that is not a coherent argument. Also, it's not just coyotes that get caught and harmed by these traps. There are less cruel ways to make money.
Coyote fur is in big demand thanks to Canada Goose parkas http:// bit.ly/2VsbMnX via @suntimes

Yes city people are in a bubble. I live in a rural area and am very much a tree hugger but I understand the need for wildlife management (by biologists) And yes moose populations have been down all over, but parasites are to blame just as much as wolves.
Today I boarded a flight before someone in a Canada Goose jacket. I guess you’re not better than me after all...
Fair enough. I'll look into this coyote problem Canada has and try to find the truth. Thanks for keeping it civil, unlike most others I was interacting with on this thread.

Never got a Canada Goose jacket (ironic, I know), but I look at parkas as investments that (should) last at least ten years. Since 1993, I've owned a total of two parkas (I had to retire one a couple years ago). Spent 400 on my latest parka

The coyote population is a very real and serious problem at the moment in many places across Canada. They're beautiful creatures, as are wolves but they need to be controlled. I'm also an advocate of trapping and the fur trade so I'm afraid we'll have to agree to disagree.
Not the case in Canada.The huggers and suburbanites who dwell far from wildlife often have more sway. Cancelling spring bear hunt only to bring it back when they showed up in their back yards.Cancelled wolf bounties and now they're everywhere.And the moose are way down in numbers

So this whole week it’s going to be -22???? People are going to go sleep with their Canada goose whilst I need to find five different blankets and make a cave
And just who exactly do you think comes up with rules on hunting? All rules and regulations are based on conclusions derived from a variety of resources within a scientific community. These regs aren't random ideas. Companies like CG just take advantage which I'm okay with.
if you wear a canada goose coat around campus but have wired earbuds im assuming the coat is fake
Canada Goose is more along my aestheic... tbh. Moose Knuckle is cute but cute next gorgeous... you know....

Canada Goose using coyote fur like how Burlington Coat Factory used dog fur 20 years back
Anecdotally, I see more Moncler in Asia/Europe over Canada Goose IMO, Moncler's consistent popularity stems from its well-known collabs (Rimowa, Fragment etc.) whereas Canada Goose 's comes from a reduction in price (on black friday) https://www. vox.com/the-goods/2019 /2/20/18233546/canada-goose-moncler-mackage-warmest-winter-jackets … via @voxdotcom pic.twitter.com/E6a1hKcEGs

You're not very good at writing are you a bot? I went to college for this I literally did my homework
And look, I support hunters, my dad's a hunter I'd rather eat wild animals than support the livestock industry... But indiscriminately trapping coyotes is not a good solution. In fact they found the more you kill them, the faster they breed and smarter they get.
Aah Glucksmann dans le caca, enfin une bonne nouvelle !! Il va pouvoir remettre son flocage canada goose sur son petit manteau d'hiver chopé en frip' pendant les soldes.
Yeah but they will never understand that. They like to criticize Canada Goose owners because they seem them as upper class people who have things they don’t have. As they drive their cars with leather seats, wear leather shoes and consume McDonald’s they criticize.
Juveniles then. It takes over a year to teach them how to hunt. Are you a wildlife biologist?
I think you forgot part of her quote Spectator!! I fixed it for you...“With the extra money, I was able to afford rent and food and pay bills and buy Canada Goose ” Poor cropping on the picture Spectator, while trying to sell her sad story!!

A picture is worth a 1,000 words. A powerful story on Ontarians affected by basic income project cancellation by @lmonseb : https://www. thestar.com/news/gta/2019/ 03/04/basic-income-project-improved-lives-but-now-its-back-to-the-food-bank.html … ...but the woman featured in photo shown wearing a Canada Goose jacket (around $800). Not exactly sending the right message!
And while I support subsistence hunting, I think it's the epitome of evil to celebrate killing animals, like you do with your profile picture.. and trophy hunting is abhorrent. Hunting should be a sacred thing, we should honor the animals that we eat. They are giving us life.
They don't die right away. I know I know.. rubber traps, but yes they do try to chew their own legs off. And the fact is, if you kill the parents, the pups will die of starvation or go after easy prey like livestock and pets. Leave the wild alone.
Well most ecosystems have evolved without us, and take care of all those problems. I agree that positive human intervention is needed to counterbalance the human exploitation but it's biologists job to figure out how, not the government or a clothing company, or any corporation.

Too much or too little of either predator or prey leads to sickly and starved animals on either side. We can either help control it or let nature run its course, which is a much more gruesome option and actually leads to the untimely death of many, many more animals.

Invest in a great Canada goose jacket. They are warm AF!
No one needs a down lamb skinned lined coat to stay warm. It is a luxury item. If people who want a coat, car or piece of jewelry have the ability to get it I don’t see anything wrong with that. I can’t afford a Porsche (I don’t want that) but I don’t begrudge those who do.
Why shouldn't the line operator have the same freedom of choice to buy the product they make with their own hands as does any other rich person who has the choice to buy the product? Isn't that why you are defensive - that RICH people get the choice to buy what they want?

Nothing like a nice Sunday afternoon trip to Trader Joe’s in Lincoln Park. Porsche’s, Beamers, Canada Goose Jackets and Titleist hats for as far as the eye can see. White people are absurd.
I think most alternatives are just as "dirty" as Canada goose with many of them wearing the added label of being made in a country with sub standard wages. CG is still great quality and lasts for years of abuse.
I have a faux leather jacket that gets so many compliments it's insane. Synthetic down has also come a long way and its hypoalergenic! No reason to use animal byproducts anymore in any type of apparel imo. Just find quality synthetic, it's out there.

What about the Hudson's Bay company and the fur trade? You like History right? So I hope you understand my concerns, I only understand yours to be: you like that $1000 coyote skin coat or want to trap coyotes cause they are dangerous? Do understand why I don't get your point?
I would love to live in the pre-industrial world. And emphasis on the industrial, ...life feeds off life, when we were subsistence hunters gatherers and farmers, we weren't "exploited" the resources, we used them, were not killing off entire species (maybe minus the ice age)
All the scruffy dragged up cunts have a reason to wear canada goose jackets now , 100% the clowns will still wear shorts with them though

someone gave me a hard time for wearing a fur coat yesterday but they were wearing a Canada Goose ... um your hood is fur too...
Well that was one thing, incorrect as it is. And where am I a hypocrite? Not accepting the exploitation of natural resources for multinational corp. profits, means living in a preindustrial revolution world, at best. When in human history have we not exploited natural resources?
So how come vine has been deleted and Canada goose hasn’t
Urge Canada Goose to end the exploitation, abuse, and killing of geese and coyotes http:// petauk.org/canadagoose
Im sorry for starting off the exchange badly, but maybe we can come to a middle ground. We both like animals more than people it seems, at least we have something in common.
You lack insight about how to have a debate with someone you disagree with, like how to not be a hypocrite. Look, I'm trying to take in what your arguments are but I can't accept human selfishness and the exploitation of natural resources for multinational corporations profits.
How many non-fatal attacks professor? 1977-2015: 165. SOME predators keep themselves in check. There's a reason we occasionally put a bounty on coyotes. And look at you; 3 or 4 posts to every one of mine. You desperate for a win or something?

I believe you would step over and injured person to save an injured dog, cause I would too (as long as it wasn't my own children, i do like some humans).
Wall the streets of Europe and you will see virtually every refugee with a Canada goose jacket.....
She's the only person who was killed by a coyote in Canada. And one of the only ones ever documented to have been, and I saw a doc a few years ago suggesting they were Coyote-wolf hybrids. I already researched this.
I lack insight in many other things? Like what? Are all biologists as arrogant as you? By the way, I would have been more impressed if you said zoologist. Nah, just kidding.
Animal suffering is stitched into every #CanadaGoose jacket! Sporting a down-filled and fur-trimmed parka isn’t cool, it’s CRUEL. https:// etcanada.com/news/426002/bi ll-maher-shames-canada-goose-for-allegedly-abusing-coyotes-and-geese-only-dches-wear-that/ …
One person has been killed by a coyotes in eastern Canada and one in California, in 30 years. If you want to be taken seriously, don't use sensationalism and suggest coyotes are some visious man eaters. Predators keep themselves in check, they're territorial they kill each other
Il y a beaucoup de donneurs de leçons ici de la Gauche Caviar. Ils administrent la ville en ce moment. Style défenseurs de ‘pitbulls’ qui portent fourrure Canada Goose . Vous voyez le style? #polmtl
Yeah instant kill ones are fine. The trap and hold are pretty fucked up. Drop cages for boat are badass though
Soft gold? In the early days of the European invasion of this continent, many creatures almost went extinct because of fashion. I will never agree with that or find logic in it.
I don't see how a multinational corporation using wild animals for their products is something I can agree with in anyway. I study history and this has not gone well before. I agree with subsistence hunters who kill and use a the parts of the animal. Remember Hudson's Bay co?
They were eradicated in the united States, aka were killed off, exterminated, in the entire lower 48. You're correct that extinct isn't the right word.
. @billmaher Thanks for calling out @canadagoose for their support of animal cruelty. I'm in Canada with my humans where it gets super cold! They don't wear #CanadaGoose bcuz there are better designed alternatives that are warm, sustainable & cruelty free for 1/2 the price
Urge Canada Goose to stop tormenting and killing animals http:// petauk.org/canadagoose
Yes you do lack insight in many things it seems. I'm a fucking biologist that's who I think I am.
I've lost cats to coyotes, I still don't want them exterminated or their families to suffer the losses of alphas, which makes the you get ones more likely to kill domestic animals. If they're to be called, let biologists do it.
Why don't we control humans like that? I'm off the belief that nature is just as important as humans. We exist because of nature and are destroying the very thing that created us. This is where me and most others diverge.

Just to put things strait: coyote and other fur animals are not trapped during reproduction season both because it would be stupid to let die the youngs and that the fur is not good during spring , summer and early fall. I don't trap, but PETA is not exactly the bible:-)

Canada Goose is the hardest flex
Coyotes are vermin, they kill livestock, pets, are one of the primary carriers of rabies, and they also harm people. They cause damage in the millions, and are overpopulated also.
STOP CANADA DOING THIS, ITS JUST FOR VAIN, SICK, IGNORANT PEOPLE. WEAR FAUX FUR & FEATHERS, NO NEED FOR THIS CRUELTY IN THIS DAY & AGE. SIGN & SHARE.
The message that purposely trapping coyotes, leaving them in agony for someone to come along and shoot them, for a vanity trim on the hoods of jackets needs to be heard. Does this CEO have any pet dogs?

Stealing and then killing 90% of animals you claim to care for Trying to outlaw the keeping of pets even though doing so would lead to population issues for cats, and death for dogs(like my 9-year old Jack Russel cross) But wait there's more

I can’t speak to the geese but you all do realize coyotes are a problem and will kill your livestock, dogs, cats, but you wouldn’t know anything about killing dogs and cats would you @peta ?
Predator control is a necessity. Most people disagree until it affects them personally like the suburbians of major Canadian centres who are losing their cats and dogs to coyotes. I didn't say eradicate them. But maintaining an equilibrium is our responsibility.

Love Bill Maher! And he’s a fantastic advocate for animals. Of course being a comedian that language is a part of the bit, but he is so smart and in touch.
The trend of Canada Goose pisses me off so much. Your elitist ass is really paying AT LEAST $550 for a generic looking coat with a logo. Bitch go to Kohl’s
Well said Bill. In today’s world there is no need to use animal skins, furs or feathers for clothing. It’s barbaric and unnecessary. I have a ton of technical outdoor gear for my job and not one is made out of animal products.
Look, I appreciate that you care for some animals, but you lack insight about the web of life. Just read up in how killing coyotes only makes them breed faster, get smarter and when alphas are killed, the younger ones kill more domestic animals cause no one teaches them to hunt.
#Canada I despise these horrific coats, #CanadaGoose has started a trend of extreme #cruelty . There are many fur-trimmed coats now that literally everyone is wearing in my city of #Toronto . People are so desperate to fit in that they are unable to think... http:// bit.ly/2NAUh26
Just try not to get stuck in the elevator this time.
Is that how YOU think? You're not screaming about saving coyotes you're screaming about how good it is to kill them. That's the difference and the fact that you don't see that makes you simplistic.

The whole world needs to hear this. Animal cruelty is just plain wrong and malevolent
The coyotes are not tortured. Modern traps are the same rubber protected ones used for catching, tagging and releasing of coyotes. Coyotes are trapped when their fur is prime and so it's after their pups are on their own. The bullet to the brain instantly kills them.

I kinda agree with you on that. I believe that you should use a quick method of death when you hunt any kind of animal. I'm not exactly sure how Canada Goose does it, though.

@canadagoose is under attack for using coyote fur. Once they've banned handguns and semi-autos, your hunting rifles are next. That battle won't be about public safety. It will be about the public's distaste for hunting. #TriggerChange pic.twitter.com/eNAJz804TB

I once saw a deer with the ass literally chewed if of it jump in 7 degree Fahrenheit salt water to get away from a couple of coyotes. Those poor coyotes must have been hungry. Animals are just as cruel as humans sometimes, or all the time I should say.
Culls don't work. If you indiscriminately trap you take the alpha out of packs which encourages breeding. Coat company's and trappers also want a flow population to cash in on, so the culling is a money making lie. Dressing in dog corpse for fashion is repulsive.

Stop believing everything you watch on your suggested YouTube videos. This has been proven false. I dont like many of PETAs tactics and think they're counterproductive but this story you're promoting is false and I will defend them.
I second that.
If there is a god that created the world, it seems obvious he would look kindly on those who protect earth and it's inhabitants, and smite those who kill for selfish reasons. Yes life feeds off life, but you are selfish and heartless, you kill things that I love, Go to hell.
Coyotes have taken the niche of wolves in the u.s., which humans exterminated. Go get a heart and a brain.
You wear a thousand dollar jacket while waiting for the bus?
I am ashamed at the amount of humans that don't even consider that other creatures feel fear and pain. Coyotes are intelligent and control vermin. They are scapegoats in the livestock buisness which is another industry that instigats fear and pain for animals.

A bounty, That's how wolves went extinct in u.s. Coyotes help control vermin. While I support subsistence hunting, this is a large corporation exploiting wildlife as a commodity, and it's stupid. People care about wildlife, even if it's cause they hunt or fish. Have a heart.
You don't care about animal welfare? You like clothes that are made with suffering wildlife so much you have to wave a false flag of freedom of choice? So it's your choice to destroy nature? I don't think that's part of true freedom. Stop the exploitation.

"Delivered custom build doghouses to dogs on chains with no shelter in freezing conditions" That's animal abuse, and a police matter. So if you want to believe they done that without notifying authorities, then that says all i need to know.

By no means are mink supposed to live in Britton, but thanks to animal conservatives (vegan protesters) my mother had to see something out of a horror movie. I owed an owl in order to hunt them and it did catch 1. And they never returned again, and they never will. Vile animals.

Lovers on the 1 train. With matching canada goose coats - like puffer fish swimming upstream against the city streams. She clutches a trader joe's bag. He wears a collar so high that everytime she speaks he must peel down a piece of his jacket like skin to hear her.

Is there any support for coyotes? Outrageous that Canada Goose would retweet this when they are quite happy to slaughter coyotes for trim for their parkas.
I work with people that wear this brand and it's all I can do to keep my mouth shit (I need my job!), but it drives me nuts and makes me depressed. People are so oblivious to the origin of a FUR trim.

There has got to be demand. People in film --especially nature photogarphers-- don't want to be wearing fur and will pay a premium for a synthetic. If there was a synthetic that cost 50% more and fuctioned like an Expedition or HeliActic people would jump on it.
If we can have a human survive in space, I feel like we can probably handle the cold.
I guess there isn't a big enough to demand to develop a superior synthetic alternative
Was this penguin from a zoo? Was it photographed in the Arctic. If so, there is a 99% chance the photographer wore a down jacket with real fur trim (unfortunately there is a noticable difference, maybe it's gotten better) If there was a better jacket: photographers would buy it. pic.twitter.com/9x2U2C2xf1

Generally I agree, most buyers don't need one but I would say the knockoffs are the bigger problem. Even less ethical sourcing. Bill Maher films in an indoor studio in NYC and has probably never done -30C filming. Standing still in the cold to get the right shot.

Why don't you stop killing all the animals that you "save"?
Mr. Halifax: I reread my tweet to you. TWICE. HOW you could interpret my message as "coyotes should be killed and left to rot" leaves me to believe that you have a severe cognative deficit. I encourage you to see a neurologist for evaluation.
I'm sorry but, your using Bill Maher as a credible source on, anything? Bill Maher isn't the least credible source to discuss anything but, he is still pretty close. Only thing less credible than Bill is The Root and Infowars.

Love killing coyotes! If they torment pets and livestock and they are massively over populated. They hurt other groups of animals. A good year is killing 20 or more.
@prettypinkacres did you know that Canada Goose pays good money for coyote pelts. They use them to line the collars. So you can eliminate them and get paid ...

First - I'm on the side of the animal every time. It's horrible what I saw and I hope the owner of that trap gets his. As to how this is allowed I'd say take it up with the trappers and manufacturers of the clothing you find offensive and dangerous. They make what consumers buy
Well said
" @CVRecord : Canada goose dies after being shot in leg by an arrow http:// dlvr.it/R004z7 "is there a shortage of them?
Will never get a @canadagoose jacket now, that's trash.
I have a very warm London Fog fake down and fake fur around the hood coat. It is extremely warm and the fake fur is soooo soft. Some fake hoodie fur is very crunchie but if you shop for & demand soft fake fur and boycott real fur they will come...they will make it.
Yeah because using animals for resources is wrong.
Which fashion trend is more grating Canada Goose or “anti social social club”? Sound off in the comments
WHY....?!?!?! There are faux furs that look and feel exactly like REAL FUR! I went off on an acquaintance for wearing fur trimmed gloves...she set me straight..."It's fake!" My comforter is filled with "fake down" and keeps me VERY warm & toasty. SMH.

Absolutely nothing wrong with using fur that’s my opinion, isome people say thats wrong, that their opinion, if the species isn’t endangered there is nothing wrong with hunt/trapping them..
Base your outfit on what someone else dislikes. What a toxic way to lead your life.
Stick to the facts not propaganda!! You yanks kill border crossers just looking for a better life!! Oh yeah they are Humans!

Yo thanks Bill! Im convinced a lot of ppl who buy the jackets don’t know how cruel they are. You’re awesome for spreading the word.
Not the facts!! We Canadians don't torture animals, humans or aliens! We polite society. Why don't you talk about the hunting in Alaska shooting from Copters! You wearing leather ? I rest my case!
Even if you don't believe this is cruelty (and I don't see how) the facts are it is not the best choice to stay warm. Modern synthetics provide much warmer outerwear and nothing has to suffer and die for it.

How much sense does this make? So... They spend ALL their time & money going to extremes with just ONE GOAL - to SAVE ANIMALS - so that they can then KILL ANIMALS? How's that work? Can you explain? Plz be smarter. Also, don't eat any more Tide pods.
It’s 60 degrees out side while I’m picking up Benjamin’s t-ball uniform and the woman in line in front of me is straight up wearing a Canada goose jacket. Someone should have warned me it’s so cold outside, here I am I a t shirt and jeans.

#CanadaGoose says "we are disappointed that #PETA continues to grossly misinform their spokespeople" in response to #BillMaher 's #RealTime segment http:// etcnda.com/lFHQeb
Rockin’ the Canada Goose . Must be cold in Brooklyn.
Maybe you shoulf address all the animals your organization puts down??
are Canada Goose fakes super convincing, or are there this many people out here dropping a thousand dollars on a single coat????

How is this nonsense?
I generally hate PETA, but I do agree with this message. Get a Columbia jacket with that omnitech thermal barrier. It's light, it's warm, and it's made from dead dinosaurs and science.

Wrong! There is no cruelty free way to trap and kill coyotes and take down from live geese!!!!!
Fucking humans, worst predators EVER! They live off & monetize everything the get their hands on. Humanity doesn't know any better way to make a living.
Stfu peta
Pro-choice..... except when it comes to clothing. *insert hypocrisy*
Thank you Bill!
Where is @cathmckenna about this? #Animals are part of our environment and eco system. I am always disgusted when I see anyone wearing Canadagoose and now they opened store in China too, where animal abuse is rampant
Peta is a greedy corporation and does nothing for animal rights. They are the real “douches”.
Every time I see a student athlete on a moped wearing canada goose and airpods I become one step closer to inciting a class war.
Good post Peta. Is there anywhere I can find this video to share without your brand attached? I love the video but when I share your stuff nobody listens cuz it's Peta. You've lost credibility with ppl from your crazier posts; like Steve Irwin - bad move, even if a tiny bit true.
That really hurt to watch, but we need the truth out there. Thank you Bill
Don't buy canada goose , shoot it!
Oui , ou alors ils sont tellement crédules et naïfs qu’elle a cru que c’et Du Canada goose . Ça ne démontre pas une attirance pour l’argent, ça démontre un souci stupide de l’apparence, pour les deux, ils feraient de bons lycéens...

I know why I'm happy: This is WONDERFUL, Bill Maher! Thank you so much! <3
Extremism
How can you ridicule PETA after all it does for the wildlife of our planet. How can our future generations survive if we continue killing animals senselessly....are you not seeing the bigger picture??
What do you wear Bill when it's minus 30?
Don’t get me wrong. I think wearing fur and what is happening is wrong, but PETA has no business being in business.

C’est malheureusement faux, on vois que la parka n’est pas Canada Goose , c’est une contrefaçon... Pour la fourrure, c’est logiquement du synthétique, mais avec celui-là ..,
Fuck Canada Goose https:// twitter.com/peta/status/11 01511998964084736 …
Not very cute or nice when they’re trying to kill you while picking psilocybin mushrooms...
Listen idiots it is not about eating meat or what other animals eat it is about animal cruelty.
Yesssssss Bill!
How about pressuring @JustinTrudeau to put an end to the brutal annual slaughter of seals in #Canada ?

Thank you for all you do for animals, Bill.
Do you want me to fall in love with you and binge watch your old stand ups? Because this is how I fall in love with you and binge watch your old stands ups <3 #canadagoosekills
Thank you for telling it like it is and speaking out for these animals!
Thank you, Bill! There's no excuse for wearing fur or down with so many great cruelty-free options available. Blood-thirst is not cool.
You’re saying eating a human is the same as another species? Are you delusional?
What do you mean?
Boo to CanadaGoose and NorthAmericanFurTrade. We’re in the 21st Century now not back in the 1750’s
People are saying, right? Anyway, Bill's message is important, so try not to distract with nonsense.
Is this for real ??? Wtf you people do realize and when I say people I mean supporters of peta. That coyotes are a menace to everything. If not killed they will kill BABIES fucking babies, dogs, cats everything they can because they eat MEAT! Or should they be taught to be vegan
Also, what does one do w/ a Christian Dior mink coat inherited from their grandmother? On one hand it’s sentimental but on the other hand it’s appalling & I could never wear it. What do you suggest @peta ?
Again you tweet from that iPad. Do you support giving money to chinese factory workers who take that money and buy dogs from cages as they poke and prod to make sure their meat will be good after slaughter?
I try to kill at least one a day..
Let’s cc @alroker and @nbc #weather staff Please set an example and stop wearing jackets and other clothing with #fur Thanks :))
What a disgusting, vile, and selfish trait to have. Torturing beings for an easily discarded earthly pleasure. It's not a necessity, nor fetching. Wonder how humans would feel having themselves, their families, children - trapped, tortured, & skinned? Cruelty is expensive - Karma

he also smells bad i heard
Glad to see you posting Yotam. I was beginning to think you could only read music. Thanks for your efforts. The thermometer on my desk says its 68.5F in Cedar Creek South Carolina so no need for a Canada Goose parka. There are, however, Canada Geese on my pond.
Go away @canadagoose ....
someone in a Canada goose just sat next to me on the train. This is a Canada goose hate account now
torn between the aftermath of going on a date with a guy wearing canada goose ... do i encourage my friends to punch me in the face or have them tell me not to mess it up
Ya stop hunting them then they can overpopulate and become your toy dogs and childrens fear in the cities
It's honestly sickening. Thanks for speaking up against @canadagoose !
yaas! so true. I will never buy a @CanadaGoose jacket.
American liberals think murdering babies at birth is ok.
God I hate rich hipsters so much. This is awful and makes my blood boil.
Now do abortion in the USA Planned Parenthood.

Mankind has created synthetic fiber that literally performs so much better than animal fur in arctic temps. Use it.
I’m very Canadian and These coats aren’t only homely, they’re unnecessary
Well, when I worked in the far North and Antarctica, I sure was glad I had my Canada Goose . On top of the that, coyotes are a nuisance and have a bounty on them across many parts of Canada. And geese, Canada ones at least, make excellent jerky.
Bill, I am a big fan but this video is like a Trump video as you are giving an opinion on something you obviously know nothing about. There is very little in your video that is true. Find out the facts.
Do they trap them??
since when did #ConspicuousConsumption become hip? oh yeah, the 1980's called... #CanadaGoose #TortureIsTorture #LiveAndLetLive
No more PETA. Don’t align with a bad group because they may have a good thought or idea. There mission is of destruction not saving animals
Thank you Bill for speaking up I wish more celebrities would follow your lead
He's in Austin.

Thank you Mr. Maher!!
Answer Bill Maher!!!! Is this true???....it is truly a coyote ugly jacket but these accusations better not be true!!!
Microx, purposely trapping coyotes, who are left in agony until someone comes along & shoots them to sell their fur for hood trims of jackets is morally reprehensible. Many animals that reach PETA have been so abused that they can’t be saved same issue for many charities.
The birds used to make these coats have their breast feathers plucked out while still alive leaving them bloody and traumatised. They are left 6 months then go through the process again before bring killed. They suffer unimaginable pain ,so refuse to buy these costs please
Canada Goose , Keep me warm in my cold city
Please remind me again how many innocent people the US is responsible for murdering in the Middle east and around the world? As bad as this may seem, I think there are more important things to focus on! #hypocrisy
Don't wear Canada Goose jackets https://www. facebook.com/824805220/post s/10161858553630221/ …
Mm yes interesting, tortured animals hm? Well explain to us why you euthanize healthy cats and dogs and say your helping the animals
Canada Goose sources coyote fur through licensed trappers who use rubber-edged leg hold traps and dispatch the animal with a bullet. This also helps control the coyote population & reduce attacks on livestock.
That trim on your Canada Goose parka? It’s coyote fur, and it’s in high demand https:// nationalpost.com/news/world/tha t-trim-on-your-canada-goose-parka-its-coyote-fur-and-its-in-high-demand …
Side note: the iPad you’re using to Tweet was built by people in china that consume DOGS. Your purchase of that iPad is going into the pockets of people who use the money to buy live dogs that they then slaughter and cook. Surely you won’t put down your excessively-priced device.
I hope that you also protest companies like Nike. Do you know how many animals die to create their leather shoes? But you target your anger and excessive time on your hands to a small Canadian company. Talk about selective outrage.
I have 2 @canadagoose jackets. Love them!
Mapother, we all hate you too
I’m no vegan, I have fur products and stuff, but mink are in no way nasty, they are mean as hell, but I find them to be beautiful hunters who demand respect, very clean animals who are in no way a rodent. We would have a lot more rats if it wasn’t for weasels
Imagine moving to Seattle and wearing that $800 Canada Goose out in the rain and utterly ruining it on your first day in town
This is why I love @billmaher .
I have never seen so many people wearing Canada Goose before.
Imagine wearing the same $800 Canada Goose parka as every other hapless motherfucker in your tax bracket. Imagine shelling out that much cash to look that basic.

@billmaher
Minks*
“Consumer” is a word. Do you have animal skin on the interior of your car? Do you own leather shoes? Furniture? Do you protest KFC, McDonald’s or Walmart? You choose to pick on people w/expensive coats that you are sad you can’t afford because you’re pissed off at the world.
Monks are awful creatures anyway. Some of the nastiest things in the natural world.
Thank you for this video. And PETA, for all that you do for animals.
I agree with you 100%
@canadagoose Shame on your unethical treatment of animals. All for $$$ Have some pride & stop inhumane treatment.
Time for #Canadians to tell #CanadaGoose to fuck off & yes the ppl who wear $1k coats are fucking douchebags https:// twitter.com/peta/status/11 01511998964084736 …
Awesome stuff Bill. How can anyone think this is ok?
You guys should make fur jackets out of the dogs you kill daily
Yes - we need to stop the animals from being killed in the first place. Those who already have fur can help by not wearing it b/c, when they do, they normalize the consumption of fur and help to grow the market for it. The killing will stop if people stop buying it.
But he's the biggest douche there is.... ahhhhhhh *feedback loop*
Also, don't be the douche who claims to care about animals yet continues to perform at @TheMirageLV year after year while saying nothing about the animals suffering there. #moneyfirstBill ?

Rinse, repeat! This shit was supposed to end WAY BACK IN THE 80s!! SMDH
The animal is still dead though. I am happy to hear the first are being put to good use. But it does not change the fact the original animal is dead. Therefore the problem is not solved.
I’m so glad now I don’t have one of these and will never buy! #DontBuyCanadaGoose
@billmaher I saw your segment about Canada Goose coats. I own one. In fact it’s the best coat I’ve ever owned. Did you know the US govt kills 90,000 coyotes per year for population control? Why don’t you protest McDonald’s. Pretty sure u gave the speech from a leather chair, too.
no @CanadaGoose why are we still having this conversation https:// twitter.com/peta/status/11 01511998964084736 …
So you guys still killing animals?
THANK YOU for the information. It was new for me. Horrible
Actually, activists donate the fur to wildlife rescue groups and sanctuaries that use it to make blankets for orphaned animals, some of whom lost their mothers because hunters and trappers killed them. This video shows how the donated furs help the orphans https:// theirturn.net/2018/05/23/Fur -coats/ …
i just read you guys snare trap coyotes for your clothing. is this true? @canadagoose please tell me this is false
This is so ridiculous. I own a Canada Goose coat. Did you know that the US alone kills 90,000 coyotes per year for population control? Why aren’t you protesting outside a McDonald’s? They kill TONS of animals. I have to say it’s the warmest coat I have ever owned and I love it
Is bill vegan? If not, I appreciate the sentiment but all of the meat and animal byproducts he consumes negates this post
@canadagoose can you stop murdering geese and coyotes now and charging hipsters $1000 to look like douche bags wearing your ugly coats!!!!!!!

If you don’t like it you have every right not to buy it, you can go again and tell me how but hurt you are but in the end it really doesn’t matter as the market depicts the product. And that product being fur actually is responsible for Canada existing
This is something that I'd animal abuse and is bad but it's how the take on it is. there are ways to harmlessly get the fur from animals in a similar way we get wool from sheep through brushing and farming fur from domesticated fox or the fallen feathers from geese

Fur will always be the go to for so many cultures especially in the north. Look to the ancient cultures for ethical handling and use of nature’s bounty. It remains to be seen if we were blessed with the technology to create synthetic material. It won’t be revealed my lifetime.

Factory farming is horrible, whether it’s for food or clothing. People should be more self sufficient when obtaining food.
I’m not. But the comment is dumb. I agree with peta about 80% of the time. But they put out some idiotic stuff sometimes. They also happen to be a slaughterhouse themselves.

No. I mean, there are less cruel ways of raising animals for down (e.g. keeping them in humane conditions while alive, killing them before harvesting the down), and Canada Goose has been called out more than once for using suppliers who don't do those things.

I was going to post the Peta link, but it’s far too disturbing. Canada Goose can claim coyotes are trapped by those following a humane trapping code, but buyers are still free to consider their own moral one. #furisdead

On another note so you maybe feel better! It’s amazing to care for animals as we do as well but trust me there are thousands of celebrities/media out there that wear a full fur jacket made by animals people like you should focus on them and not on Patricia spreading positivity!!

She does not support animal cruelty and if you are going to buy her a jacket at her standards then she’ll be happy to wear it! You cannot tell anyone what to wear or not! We removed the fur and thats it! Take a walk now and go comment on someone’s else profile
What to you guys have against this great Canadian company? Coyotes are a problem around here! @canadagoose
So now you are promoting a company on her page? I used curse words because this is enough now! Patricia all she does is spread love and positivity and people like you who hide behind their twitter profile and attach the wrong people! Patricia does not support animal cruelty!
Now you down a couple Gs in personal property You get *another Canada Goose . And replace the watch Roll out the crib: same time, same route, no police report that you got your pockets run the last time & now you got Beats on too Cat rolls up again, clockwork. And just laughs
You get another Canada Goose . Roll out the crib: same time, same route, no police report that you got your pockets run the last time Same dude approaches you again, laughing: “Ay homey, run that Goose. And while you at it, why don’t you come up off that watch too?
@peta is @canadagoose the only one you consider bad or are there other ones? Your campaigns seem very targeted against them, shouldn’t you be yelling at all of them?
It is astonishing & infuriating that faculty—of ALL groups—do not get this So let me try another route It’s cold. You’re rocking Canada Goose , on your way to wherever Cat approaches you: “Yo, homeboy: run that coat” To avoid adverse impact, you hand over the coat
As I said I don’t give a dam about any brands I wear what I want! We show enough support but removing completely the fur. So unless you’ll buy our jackets you shut your mouth and don’t attach the wrong people! Don’t hide behind your twitter account and spread fake news please!
We don’t wear fur at all not because we care about clowns like you who instead of actually going and commenting at those celebrities that were full polar bear coats etc come and attack the wrong people!! We don’t support animal cruelty whatsoever so stop trying to reach!
where in my recent reply did I mention the fur? its about supply & demand you or I buy any product from A brand, you are keeping that brand alive. The most ethical brand to endorse & warmer for your part of the world is @WuxlyMovement using 'curse' words demeans your reply
Yes executive manager with no followers cuz I don’t give a f*ck about them! Google my name and see what I do I don’t need followers or that crap. Also I don’t give a dam about Canada Goose at all and if you do some more research you’ll see Patricia and I don’t wear fur jackets!

Hypocrite
Hope that skins and scalps of Canada Goose fur suppliers will come in fashion soon. I would buy a parka trimmed with such for sure.
so you support Animal Abuse? 'Executive Manager' with 158 followers? Your probably the one who gave her that #Cruelty coat, Nothing negative about calling out supporters of Canada Douche https:// youtu.be/qKRpJneXdw4
previous reply said it facts! She is supporting a brand of well known #AnimalAbusers I don't spread hate I do hav #Compassion & constantly fight for those who cannot speak THE ANIMALS The down trade is equally abusive, She IS wearing coat with down in it. https:// youtu.be/qKRpJneXdw4

Highlights from the garden this morning: first ever sighting, on the deck, of Canada Goose , pair of Grey Wagtail prospecting under the House, singing Siskin, & Goldcrest. Pheasant heard yet again, I think seeing this one is going to cost me be a bag of grain, I’m off to the shops

The Amazon jacket is made by a Chinese company called Orolay -- and its jackets contain 90% duck-down filling, which is the same amount you'd find in Canada Goose 's $800 parkas. It’s sold on Amazon for $100. And it’s the most popular coat of the winter.

Oh yeah? Which nations have too much population? Which nations have birth rates that are growing the population? Any nations contracting their population? As far as a coat, our skin would make a terrible coat, and coyotes are not people. Do you eat meat?
We are over populated with humans, too, but no ones making a coat out of us!

All those fur-trimmed Canada Goose coats: Bad news for coyotes, big money for trappers. The demand for coyote fur is still growing despite all the information about the cruelty to coyotes that’s out there.

I've never seen someone use a bear trap on coyotes most of the time it's a snare trap so the suffocate themselves quick. Vs if a dog accidentally gets caught they know what a leash is like don't struggle and survive
Could you imagine yourself getting caught in a bear trap and then left to starve for days then a coward comes up to you without a chance to run and shoots you in the head. That’s the most barbaric thing I’ve ever heard of
Yes actually. 100% without a doubt that’s better than having them get caught in a bear trap freaking out and tearing there leg up while starving three days then some coward walks up to it when it’s alone and afraid and shoots it in the head.
Fur experts say an uptick in coyote fur demand began with Canada Goose parkas http:// apne.ws/6SKMo4m
The gobshit in his fake Canada Goose
Would you rather people shot them ruining the pelt and get nothing from them?
I won’t wear Canada Goose because they kill coyotes for fashion.
Don't buy from them then. But there are to many coyotes, they are listed as a pest animal and exterminated, why not use the fur. https://www. washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/a nimalia/wp/2018/05/22/heres-why-there-are-so-many-coyotes-and-why-they-are-spreading-so-fast/ …

How disgusting to think Polar Bears have a beauty and value in the natural world but be hideous enough to support animal abusing corpse clothes like the most hated company ever Canada Goose . You'd be very pretty if you didn't wear that, you can do so much better.
Fur is not fashion. It is unnecessary and not the way of the future. If Canada Goose is smart they will change course as soon as possible.

Canada goose coats... the insides are stuffed with feathers from geese and the fur on the outside is made from coyotes . Geese can deffo fly and again dinosaurs are real
People like #canadagoose and others should stop this practice. It is decorative and provides nothing other than the horrible slaughter of a beautiful animal. Let nature worry about overpopulation and let them live.

Ah yes but there is a coyote problem in some parts of North America, where they are destroying parts of the ecosystems, killing them can control their populations and Canada even allowed Canada Goose to kill certain amounts of coyotes.

If you have a Canada goose then fuck you
your experience is unlike everyone’s around you. That you dumb dipshit in your Canada Goose , that you’re special? That you think differently. Newsflash buddy, we’re all fucking special. Who cares. Me: ... Okay ... not gonna lie. That was a little awkward (turtle) . Cashi 11/
long enough, you start to notice how we’re all pretty similar. We all want the best cookie, we all begrudgingly wait in lines, we are all still wearing Canada goose for some reason. And that makes you talk. To the person in front of you, behind you, it doesn’t really matter. 8/
Calf-length Canada Goose jackets look absolutely ridiculous on short people. We already have little bodies, don't make it worse for yourself. #thanksforlistening #TedTalk
@canadagoose is a nasty ass company why do I still see people wearing them everywhere
Did I really just see a @canadagoose ad on Facebook about saving polar bears? Like... umm... maybe let’s not advertise the select animals you wish were saved? that’s like.. animal racism
